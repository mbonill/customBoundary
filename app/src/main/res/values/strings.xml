    <string name="component_instructions">Welcome. This interface will help you set up a home
        boundary. Please make sure GPS is enabled then move the device to each of the four compass
        directions at the corresponding edge of the boundary you wish to create and hit the button
        labeled with that direction. The calculated latitude/longitude will be displayed with the
        accuracy in meters following it. Try hitting the button multiple times to possibly store a
        higher accuracy if available. After saving all locations, try using the track button and the
        app will tell you if you are in bounds. If out of bounds the direction will be indicated.
